I was struggling a litle with undersatanding Tailwind. 
i still dont find it very familiar since it's very confusing .

i learned alot from the project more about css frameWorks and how they make our work easier.

i will need to improve my tailwind skills since its a very good tool to use .

# Learning Reflections README 

## **6.15 CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile Project**

### Overview
i Learned alot about CSS .It was a bit overwhelming working with tailwind and both using css in html.

### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery
- **Responsive Design**: My website is very responsive but so far i'm good with desktop and also learning new ways to make a site responsive using xl,sm on html.
- **Styling Elements**: just using components of tailwind in html were very confusing but i managed to get ahold of it.

#### Challenges Faced

- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**: I need to look more into responsive design because i'm very confused , because sometimes when i used sm on html my site didnt respond. 
- **Hover and Focus Effects**: using the hovers and effects with tailwind was very challenging since i was used to using them on css, but i was aware of what was happening .

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Advanced CSS Properties**: I need to work on responsive designs, hovers, focus, and other css properties because my codes sometimes dont work and its hard to find errors.
- **Code Optimization**:  following the steps made me understand what was needed and i had to figure out on my own.
- **Creative Design Choices**: i think i need to work on more layouts to understand where to apply some of the css propertie with tailwind components.

#### Overall Learning Experience

This helped me to follow exactly what was needed and to see if i really understood what was happening, i need to manage my time very well and spend alot of time understanding the basic things and not get confused .
